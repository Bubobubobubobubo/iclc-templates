# ICLC 2023 - Proposal for Written Community Reports

For written reports, please follow the full instructions for this category in the README file in this directory, excerpted here: 

## Written Reports
Written reports must use the templates for Papers, with 3 important differences:

1. Length: 2-6 pages
2. "Abstract" to be replaced with "Summary" (max. 300 words)
3. Citations may be unnecessary

Note the .md template for Papers includes additional instructions for exporting to PDF, as explained above.
