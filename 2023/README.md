# International Conference on Live Coding 2023 - Submission Templates

In this package, you can find the submission templates for:

* Papers
* Live Performances
* Community Reports
* Workshops
* Video Gallery Submissions

## Papers

The templates for papers are available in two formats, in *Markdown* (also known as
*Commonmark*) format, and Microsoft Word.

Independent of which format you choose, please make sure you submit
your contribution as a PDF file !

The short biographies of the contributors (max. 150 words) can be attached as an informal PDF in the 
submission system. Please **don't** include it in the paper itself !

### Markdown / Commonmark

With the Markdown template, you write your paper as a text file, with
simple markup to specify formatting, citations and the inclusion of
images. This file (README.md) is itself formatted in the *Markdown*
format. For more information please refer to the template itself,
which is *papers/markdown/iclc2023.md*. The template contains a 
tutorial on how to convert the Markdown file to PDF. 

You need [**Pandoc**](http://pandoc.org) and a LaTeX distribution installed to create the PDF.

### Microsoft Word Template

This template comes in the form of an MS Word document, where you
replace the example text with that of your paper. The template is
in papers/doc/iclc2023.doc.

Editing the template with LibreOffice shouldn't be problematic either.
