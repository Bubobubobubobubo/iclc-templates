## Instructions

The working templates for each category are available in two formats: in *Markdown* (also known as *Commonmark*) format, and Microsoft Word.

* ***Independent of which template you choose to work with, please make sure you submit your contribution as a PDF file!***  
* PDF files must be attached to the OpenConf Submission AFTER submitting the initial form. Please read instructions on the submission page to make sure your attachment is received. 

Please see below for template instructions specific to each presentation category.

### Markdown / Commonmark templates

With the Markdown template, you write your paper as a text file, with simple markup to specify formatting, citations and the inclusion of images. This file (README.md) is itself formatted in the *Markdown* format. 

To convert Markdown files to PDF You need [**Pandoc**](http://pandoc.org) and a LaTeX distribution installed. In addition:

 - *Papers template*: for more information please refer to the template itself. Because the template is a bit more complex, we have included a tutorial on how to convert the Markdown file to PDF. 
 - *Other templates*: to convert basic Markdown files to PDF, run the following command: 
```
pandoc your_proposal.md -o your_proposal.pdf
```
### Microsoft Word templates

This template comes in the form of an MS Word document, where you replace the example text with that of your paper. Please follow examples for sections, figures, and citations.

This template should also work for LibreOffice or Google Docs.

## Community Reports

Community Reports can be submitted in 2 different formats: written or video. Note that ALL Community Reports will be published in the Conference proceedings, and video reports will be automatically included in the online Video Gallery.
