# International Conference on Live Coding 2023 - Submission Templates

In this package, you can find the submission templates for:

* Papers
* Live Performances
* Community Reports
* Workshops

## Papers

The templates for papers are available in two formats, in *Markdown* (also known as
*Commonmark*) format, and Microsoft Word.

Independent of which format you choose, please make sure you submit
your contribution as a PDF file !

### Markdown / Commonmark

With the Markdown template, you write your paper as a text file, with
simple markup to specify formatting, citations and the inclusion of
images. This file (readme.txt) is itself formatted in the *Markdown*
format. For more information please refer to the template itself,
which is papers/markdown/iclc2023.txt.

### Microsoft Word Template

This template comes in the form of an MS Word document, where you
replace the example text with that of your paper. The template is
in papers/word/iclc2023.doc.

It's the older .doc format, not .docx, so editing it with LibreOffice
shouldn't be problematic either.
