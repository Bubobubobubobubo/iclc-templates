# ICLC 2025 - Proposal for Installations

Installation formats include audio, visual, A/V, multimedia and hardware. As we explore venues and dates, and according to patterns that we see emerge from the submissions received, we intend to set installations either in a dedicated space for all of them as an exhibition, or scattered around where other ICLC events take place.

Be as thorough as possible with the Technical Questionnaire and add a link to a plan or sketch with measurements (metric, please) so that we can avoid surprises. **Bear in mind the feasibility** of presenting it with few or **no hardware provided by us**. Although we are working hard to get ways to provide projectors, screens and sound systems, we cannot assure you'll get what your installation needs. If you can bring your own hardware, please clearly specify it, as that would help us a lot.
