# International Conference on Live Coding 2024 - Submission Templates

In this package, you can find the instructions and submission templates for proposals in the following presentation categories:

* Papers (short or long)
* Live Performances (concert or Algorave)
* Workshops (short or long)
* Open Submissions (written or video)

## Instructions

The working templates for each category are available in two formats: in *Markdown* (also known as *Commonmark*) format, and Microsoft Word.

* ***Independent of which template you choose to work with, please make sure you submit your contribution as a PDF file!***  
* PDF files must be included in the submission in CMT. Please read instructions on the submission page to make sure your attachment is received. 

Please see below for template instructions specific to each presentation category.

### Markdown / Commonmark templates

With the Markdown template, you write your paper as a text file, with simple markup to specify formatting, citations and the inclusion of images. This file (README.md) is itself formatted in the *Markdown* format. 

To convert Markdown files to PDF You need [**Pandoc**](http://pandoc.org) and a LaTeX distribution installed.

**Note: We have received word of possible compatibility issues with very recent versions of Pandoc. ("Lonely \item--...") We're looking into those now, but if you are affected, consider trying a [pre-compiled binary](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/tag/3.1.5) of an older version of Pandoc, which is working.**

In addition:

 - *Papers template*: for more information please refer to the template itself. Because the template is a bit more complex, we have included a tutorial on how to convert the Markdown file to PDF. 
 - *Other templates*: to convert basic Markdown files to PDF, run the following command: 
```
pandoc your_proposal.md -o your_proposal.pdf
```

### Microsoft Word templates

This template comes in the form of an MS Word document, where you replace the example text with that of your paper. Please follow examples for sections, figures, and citations.
